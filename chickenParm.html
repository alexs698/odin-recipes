    <h2>A Super Easy Recipe For The Entire Family</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite meals ever to both make for the entire family and eat. It does not take long at all to make and you can make it with just about any type of noodle. You can make your own marinara sauce but my favorite thing to do is use Rao's Marinara sauce and add a little extra garlic and seasoning to it. Also, even though it may be a bit more expensive, I always try ot use fresh cheese. It tastes so much better this way and you will thank me later. As far as how much cheese to use, I will leave that up to you.</p>

        <li>2 Rao's Marinara Sauce</li>
